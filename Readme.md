The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

submit: 
1) a tidy data set, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) a code book (CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean the data. 
4) a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
